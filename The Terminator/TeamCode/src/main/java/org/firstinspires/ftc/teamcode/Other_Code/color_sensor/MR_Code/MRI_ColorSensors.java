/*
Modern Robotics Color Sensor Active & Passive Example using 2 colro sensors
Created 7/25/2016 by Colton Mehlhoff of Modern Robotics using FTC SDK 1.6
Reuse permitted with credit where credit is due

Configuration:
Color sensor at default I2C address of 0x3C named "ca"
Color sensor at I2C address of 0x60 named "cb"
Touch sensor named "t" and connected to the port specified by the user in their config file

This program can be run without a battery and Power Destitution Module
